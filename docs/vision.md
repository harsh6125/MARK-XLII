\# ScholarLink – Product Vision (MARK-XLII)



\## What is ScholarLink?

ScholarLink is a student–startup collaboration platform designed to

connect students with early-stage startups for structured work,

projects, and contribution-based collaboration.



The platform focuses on reducing friction in discovering,

evaluating, and initiating student–startup engagements.

\## Target Users



\### Students

\- Individuals looking to work on:

&nbsp; - Startup projects

&nbsp; - Early-stage product development

&nbsp; - Skill-aligned contributions

\- Prefer clarity, ownership, and real work over generic listings.



\### Startups

\- Early-stage or growing startups

\- Looking for:

&nbsp; - Contributors

&nbsp; - Interns or project-based collaborators

&nbsp; - Short-term or long-term support

\- Need a focused, low-noise way to engage students.

\## Core Problem



\- Startups struggle to:

&nbsp; - Reach relevant students

&nbsp; - Filter serious contributors

&nbsp; - Manage applications efficiently



\- Students struggle to:

&nbsp; - Discover legitimate startup opportunities

&nbsp; - Understand expectations before applying

&nbsp; - Communicate directly after initial contact



Existing platforms are either:

\- Too generic

\- Too noisy

\- Not designed for student–startup workflows

\- Clear role-based access (Student / Startup)

\- Structured profiles

\- Well-defined opportunity listings

\- Direct application and review flow

\- Controlled, purpose-driven communication



The platform prioritizes:

\- Simplicity

\- Transparency

\- Structured collaboration

over growth-driven or social features.
